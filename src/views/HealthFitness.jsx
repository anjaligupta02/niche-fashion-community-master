											That totally depends on how you look at it. Connecting it with the old song of Dimple Kapadia

													are born out of challenges. So this lockdown is a challenge that could be used to transform
													ourselves into a hard metal that will shine forever. He then himself puts up a question — "Are
													human beings so scared of a disease that we can't even take care of ourselves?" But he says
													that he has always learned to be only scared of God. Certainly, we are all scared presently
													but we must take a lot of consideration. We have all just tried to ruin our bodies. Instead,
													our bodies should be nurtured rather than making it a bad gutter. For that matter, we have to
													stop consuming junk. Whether that junk is on TV, on web series, in daily soap operas, or junk
													in the food. So stop being junkies and stop collecting junk from around. </p>

													suspended animation condition right now. Most of us are alive but are not throbbing with life.
													One should have infinite invisible energy immunity so as to throb with your life. Good
													immunity comes from fresh air, sunshine, clean water, meditation, and good food. He says to
													begin with good eating must start eating fruits. Fruits that are fresh and sweet renovate your
													body. So one should always enjoy fruit-eating. He likes to twist, turn, tumble, and pull up.
													So he likes to eat groundnuts as he likes to workout like monkeys. Mickey likes bananas, he
													says the elephants are strong as they eat so many bananas so he also loves to eat a banana
													every day. An apple a day keeps a doctor away but fruits every day will keep the doctor out of
													your way.
