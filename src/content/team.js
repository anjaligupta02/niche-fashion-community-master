        "Working with THE NICHE Fashion Arena International as the Senior Executive Editor— International Brands has been a truly wonderful journey as I have learnt many new and exciting things about what takes place behind closed doors in the world of fashion.",
        "Traditional fashion capitals such as Paris, Milan, USA and London have always been world renowned for their bold and alluring fashion which, over the years, has become a global sensation but some of the new and up-and-coming fashion hubs such as India, Persia, Hong Kong and Dubai have many undiscovered brands and fashion styles which are catching on quickly.",
        "Finding relevant information to work with is often perceived as a boring and strenuous task but it is not quite so. While researching the fashion trends of various International countries, I have learnt quite a lot about the country's heritage and culture which has truly broadened my mind and opened me to perceive their fashion in a new light.",
        "Writing certain articles such as the Fashion Forecast for 2020 were very challenging as they involved heavy research of the International fashion trends over the past couple of years. Older styles had to be infused with the preferences of this generation of novel fashion to be able to predict what the next cycle of the fashion industry had in store for us.",
        "Some everlasting trends such as 80s fashion and punk rock have found its way into the 2020 fashion rotation whereas newer trends such as neon clothing and oversized clothes with excessive volume are a newer but much-loved addition to this year's fashion cycle.",
        'In the end, we must remember that fashion is subjective and ever-changing and can mean different things to different people. Many of the fashion icons were also once criticized because they dared to dream about what had never been done before but they did not let that stop them. "The goal, ultimately, is to create something that has never been done before and which will further inspire the future generations to continue the pattern in the same way", Vahiste\'s messege to the readers of Global Fashion Community.',

        "Well, we amended the stories about those brands which are highly around us. When ideas started percolating for this issue ultimately research work began. As we know Indian textile is very popular around the globe so we picked the first brand, Sabyasachi — Decoding Sabyasachi's design philosophy is very simple and clear. It is all about personalized perfection of the human hand. Antique textiles and cultural tradition of Kolkata has been a lifelong inspiration for this designer. Another exciting brand we picked was, Da Milano — Nearly three-decade Indian high-end leather accessories brand is famous for its unique style and creative aesthetics. So here we draw upon fashion taste into leather accessories.",
