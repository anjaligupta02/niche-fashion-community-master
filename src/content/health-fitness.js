				question: "Do Indians have better immunity than others?",
				answer: "He says - Well, yes. It's because Indians have always been exposed to challenging conditions of the environment and always rose up stronger. We are all healthy and it's all because India belongs to gurus like Sadguru, Baba Ram Dev, Maha Rishi, Mahesh yogi, and Mahansa Ji because of whom we are all gifted to live life better by practising Yoga. YOGA - karo yoga yoga yoga Jaisa chhahoge waisa tumhara Badan hoga. Yoga is great for vitality for the mind and body to uplift awareness about the spirit which is more than physical body. Something which gives you an extra-sensory perception of life."

				question: "How to maintain a healthy mind?",
				answer: "Mickey says - Empty the mind, mind the emptiness. A full mind is madness. An empty mind is well ness. A peaceful mind has no junk, it has the — • potential to see, perceive, transmit, learn, grow and earn. So silencing your mind with good hobbies like poetry, painting, singing, swimming etc... Quoting the example of Aamir Khan as he takes a lot of baths just to refresh his mind. So always distress your mind and charge your mind with goodness."

				question: "What is your idea of perfect quarantine activity?",
				answer: "He answers this with a big smile and says - make the best of the people around you. With people you have not done much before, people you have never gelled well before, with people you had differences before. So it's time to makeup and add value to your relationships."
			},
			{
				question: "Is there any way to know how strong your immune system is?",
				answer: "Here he talks about that, he is currently working on it with Ayurvedic doctors and sports medicine people to measure the good immune. But of course, it's better to build endurance. A good bowel movement every day around the same time indicates strong immunity. Also if the NEN interest level for life is good that also a good immune."

				question: "How to stay calm and positive when there is so much negativity around?",
				answer: "He says- when the negativity reaches you don't attend to it, don't react to it. Then ultimately the negativity will start losing its strength and will fade without even reaching your mind."
			},
			{
				question: "How to cope with the lack of human interaction in this lockdown?",
				answer: "He says this is very interesting. We have known the world we haven't known our own self. The true nature of ourselves is unknown and it's mysterious and hence unrevealing of our own self is very important. This is the right time we should deep dive within and then this social distancing will not disturb us. Then only there will be infinite joy and you will not need anybody else."

				question: "How to do a compact strength routine?",
				answer: "Mickey says - rather than focusing on strength building one should focus on energy. Energy through activities, food, breathing, meditation because energy is eternal nothing could destroy it. But simple strength-building strategies could be push-ups, pull-ups, planks, lunges, and exercise with a dumbbell."
